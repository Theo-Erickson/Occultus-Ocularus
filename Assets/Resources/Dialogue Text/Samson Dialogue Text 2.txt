Awww, crap. Something messed up the power
grid. How am I supposed to give you a dramatic
presentation now?
|
Hey, since you’re fresh out of the fountain.... no
Halo or anything....
|
How about this: you go figure out how to get the
power back on. It’ll probably take some thinking,
and it’ll be a big help to everyone in the city.

It’ll make more sense once you start. Go ahead,
try lining up the lasers over there. Anyway... I’ll
meet you once you’re done! See ya later!
