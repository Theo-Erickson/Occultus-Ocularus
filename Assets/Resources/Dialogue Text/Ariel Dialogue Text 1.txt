(Ariel rushes on screen)

ARIEL: Where's the emergency?
|
ARIEL: Oh. The lights are already back on…
|
ARIEL: I'm Ariel. And you are?
|
ARIEL: Oh! Oh, wow, you're really new, aren't you? Were you the one who fixed this?

|
(Silence)
|
ARIEL: ...Are you sure you did it right?
|
(Silence)
|
ARIEL: Either way! That was...ambitious of you.
|
ARIEL: Did you...have any help? 
|
(Samson appears)
|
SAMSON: Oh, wow, you actually did it. I'm impressed. 
|
ARIEL: Samson.
|
SAMSON: Oh. Hey. Ariel.
|
ARIEL: You made them do this?
|
SAMSON: I wouldn’t say I made them…
|
SAMSON: I helped them. I guided them.
|
ARIEL: …
|
SAMSON: Come on! They got some experience with the world, worked their mental muscles, and I'd definitely say it counted as a “good deed”. 
|
ARIEL: I see. Well, if that's the case...young one, I'm proud of you. If you keep this up, you might Ascend soon.
|
SAMSON: Oh, they don't know what Ascension is yet.
|
ARIEL: ...And you sent them to reconnect all the power in the city. With no explanation.
|
SAMSON: You're not….wrong. 
|
ARIEL: ...In any case, better late than never. I suppose I’ll explain how things work around here.
|
SAMSON: Cool, guess I’m not needed here. Yo, kid, I’ll see you around. Good luck with your Ascension. And Ariel, good luck with your, uh….you know.
|
SAMSON: Anyway, later.
(Samson vanishes)
|
ARIEL: I’m sorry about him. He’s...well, he’s been through a lot.
|
ARIEL: But, we digress! Regarding Ascension…
|
ARIEL: To put it simply, Ascension is how you know you’re on the right path. It’s a measure of how far you’ve come over time — a reflection of personal growth, both intellectual and emotional.
|
ARIEL: Perhaps an example will help! You reconnecting the power in the city — that must have taken a lot of hard thinking. But turning the power back on also helped a lot of people — a selfless act. If you do a lot of things like that, eventually you might —

(player undergoes transformation, eyes open on shoulders. ariel is understandably surprised)
|
ARIEL: Congratulations! You did it! I'm proud of you. It's unfortunate Samson isn't here to see it.
|
ARIEL: You'll notice you've grown a few extra eyes! That's an indication of your level of enlightenment. Every time you'll ascend, you'll get a few more. It takes a lot of dedication, to yourself and those around you./ The extra eyes also come with some...benefits, so to speak. You'll be able to see the world in new ways, and change your perspective./As you continue on your journey, you might notice places where you can't proceed with your current perspective. If somewhere else — some other layer of your view — seems more viable, [SHIFT] between layers. 
|
ARIEL: Go ahead, try it in the areas up ahead! The best way to learn is through practice.
